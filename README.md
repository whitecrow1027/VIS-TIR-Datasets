# VIS-TIR Datasets
A visible-light and thermal-infrared images datasets for dual-spectrum depth estimation

You can download the dataset with [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1nQt-e3wxJdfMEuafnE7cGQ?pwd=msdd)

If you are inconvenient to use BaiduYun, we will update a download link for Onedrive later.

## Hardware system for data collection
We use two hybrid [RGB-Thermal cameras](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8794320) which can output optical-aligned visible-light(VIS) and thermal-infrared(TIR) images to build a dual-spectrum stereo camera. A Velodyne-64E LiDAR sensor is used for 3D point cloud to get ground-truth.

The stereo baseline between left and right camera is 0.5m, and the camera focal length is 1.6345*10^3mm

update: add calibration parameter from Matlab. Please note that:
1. The released images have been calibrated. 
2. The calibration parameter of the original image with image size 1280x960. The released images are cut to remove some of the sky area at the top with the final size 1280x800.

## Data exapmle
For our dual-spectrum stereo camera, each data frame
contains six images: left/right VIS images, left/right TIR image,
and left/right depth map ground-truth.

Datasets contains images with varing sences and illuminations.
